1) We download from NCBI, the best blast hits for each genome of the 16S and 23S rDNA (retrieved from Barnap). We select the best hits and treat them as Reference genomes. 
2) In Bandage we blast the scaffolds with the genomes downloaded from NCBI. 
3) We select and download scaffolds manually from Bandage  (from the Spades scaffolds output). The selection is based on orientation and best the colored blast hits.
