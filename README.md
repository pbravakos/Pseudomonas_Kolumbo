# Bacterial genome analyis pipeline
This is the pipeline for the genome assembly, genome annotation, pangenome and phylogenomic analysis of <em>Pseudomonas</em> bacterial strains isolated from Kolumbo, Santorini, Greece.
Scripts presented here run in Bash v.4.4.12 and were prepared to be handled by the SLURM v.16.05.9 manager of the [High Perfomance Computer](https://hpc.hcmr.gr/) of [IMBBC HCMR Crete](http://www.imbbc.hcmr.gr/). 
Please be warned that in order for these scripts to be used in any other system, significant changes should be applied.
