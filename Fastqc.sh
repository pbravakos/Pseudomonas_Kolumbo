	This script takes as input one argument. 
	For Strain 01 that would be: 
	script.sh Strain01
	This script runs from the master folder of FastQC and then we change directory to the folder of each specific Strain folder.
	We assume that in the master folder there are already folders named Strain01 Strain02 etc.

	Here we take the raw fastq files, taken from the illumina machine, and check their quality.

	We have already created soft links of each raw fastq paired reads inside the correct directory
